# Treasure Hunt Game
Welcome to the Treasure Hunt Game repository!

This project is a Python terminal-based game developed as a study project utilizing the NumPy library. In this game, players embark on an exciting treasure hunt adventure where they navigate through a matrix grid to find hidden treasures. The player's position is represented by the number zero on the grid, and they must strategically navigate through the matrix to uncover treasures.

### Features
- Utilizes NumPy library for efficient matrix operations.
- Terminal-based interface for easy interaction.
- Random generation of treasures for dynamic gameplay.
- Player movement controls for navigation within the matrix.
- Scoring based on the number of movements taken to find treasures.

  
### How to Play
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
